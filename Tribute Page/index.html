                     that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as <br> 
                     we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous <br>
                      because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long <br>
                       time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
